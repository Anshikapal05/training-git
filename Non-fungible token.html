    <h1>What is a Non-fungible Token?</h1>
    <p>A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital identifier recorded on a blockchain, certifying authenticity and ownership. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are fungible, NFTs are tied to specific digital assets like images or videos. While NFTs can be bought and sold, their ownership does not necessarily grant legal rights such as copyright over the associated file. NFTs are often viewed as proof of ownership, but the legal implications remain uncertain.</p>
