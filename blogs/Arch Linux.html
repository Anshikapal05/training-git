	<h1>What is Arch Linux</h1>
  <p>
    Arch Linux (/ɑːrtʃ/)[8][9] is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.
